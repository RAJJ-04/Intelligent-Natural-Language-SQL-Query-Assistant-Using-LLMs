How It Works
User submits a question in English (e.g., "Which products had the highest sales last month?").

The LLM interprets the question and generates an appropriate SQL query.

The SQL query is run on your database.

The result and the generated SQL are displayed for review and learning.

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or manually:

bash
pip install streamlit langchain langchain-community langchain-openai mysql-connector-python
Configuration
Set up MySQL database and tables.

Obtain an OpenAI API key (or Perplexity, etc.).

Set your credentials as environment variables (recommended) or edit them in app.py:

OPENAI_API_KEY

MYSQL_URI (e.g., mysql+mysqlconnector://user:password@localhost:3306/yourdbname)
